## [2026-06-10] Phase 1 implementation

### Bug fixes

**[BUG FIX] `learning_rules/deep_eprop.py` — L=1 missing W_in gradient**
When `compute_deep_eprop_gradients` is called with a single-layer model
(`DeepRNN(n_layers=1)`), the gradient for `W_in` was never accumulated and
remained zero.  Root cause: gradient accumulation for `W_in` was placed
exclusively inside the "lower layers" cross-trace loop
(`for l_src in range(L-1)`), which is empty for `L=1`.  The self-trace
`eps_self_in` correctly tracked `∂h^0/∂W_in` but was never contracted with the
learning signal.

Fix: added a guarded clause after the top-layer self-trace block:

```python
if Lt == 0:          # layer 0 is both top AND the input layer
    grad_W_in += einsum('bi,bij->ij', delta, eps_self_in) / B
```

This does not affect `L >= 2` (where `Lt >= 1`, so the condition is false).
Detected by `tests/sanity_checks.py` Test 2 ("depth-1 deep e-prop == single-layer e-prop").

### New files

- **`tasks/cue_accumulation.py`** — Evidence accumulation task.  Over a cue
  window the network sees brief left/right pulses, then a silent delay `D`, then
  a single recall step.  Majority side wins.  Same interface as
  `store_and_recall.py`: `generate_batch(...)` → `(inputs, targets, mask)` and
  `task_accuracy(...)`.  `n_in=5` (left, right, recall, noise, bias),
  `n_out=2`.  The delay `D` is the primary difficulty knob: running evidence
  must survive `D` silent steps, which is only possible if stored in the
  per-neuron slow state.

- **`models/leaky_rnn.py`** — Promoted from `models/vanilla_rnn.py::LeakyRNN`.
  New version stores `alpha` as a registered buffer (shape `(n_rec,)`), supports
  optional per-neuron log-uniform alphas via `alpha_min` / `alpha_max`
  constructor arguments.  Compatible with `compute_eprop_leaky_gradients` (which
  already broadcasts over `(n_rec,)` alpha tensors).

- **`learning_rules/interface.py`** — `LearningRule` base class with
  `compute_gradients` / `update` methods, `apply_gradients` utility, and
  `make_learning_rule` factory for swappable rules from a single config string.
  Per-condition LR heuristic `lr_for_config(base_lr, depth, alpha)`.

- **`utils.py`** — `run_multi_seed` for aggregated multi-seed experiments with
  mean ± standard-error; `cosine_similarity_grads` helper.

- **`tests/__init__.py`** — Empty package init.

- **`tests/sanity_checks.py`** — Standalone fast correctness suite (6 tests,
  CPU-only, tiny nets, < 60 s total):
  0. Cue accumulation task: shapes, mask.sum()==B, label balance, frozen-net accuracy
  1. deep-RTRL gradient == BPTT to numerical precision (allclose + cosine ≈ 1)
  2. depth-1 deep e-prop == single-layer e-prop (catches the L=1 W_in bug)
  3. Finite-difference check of BPTT gradients on a tiny VanillaRNN
  4. Vanilla RNN: e-prop ≈ d=0 (carry ≈ 0 for tanh; documented as EXPECTED)
  5. Leaky RNN at long delay D: e-prop gradient meaningfully closer to BPTT
     than d=0 (the key hypothesis wedge)

### Modified files

- **`learning_rules/deep_eprop.py`** — Applied L=1 W_in gradient fix (see Bug
  fixes above).

- **`learning_rules/bptt.py`** — `compute_bptt_gradients` now uses
  `model.named_parameters()` instead of hard-coded attribute access, making it
  model-agnostic (works for `VanillaRNN`, `LeakyRNN`, `DeepRNN`).  Return keys
  now match whatever the model's named parameters are (backwards compatible for
  `VanillaRNN`).

- **`models/__init__.py`** — Exports `VanillaRNN`, `LeakyRNN` (from
  `leaky_rnn.py`), `DeepRNN`, `LIFNetwork`, `ALIFNetwork`, `LIFHeteroNetwork`.

- **`learning_rules/__init__.py`** — Exports all gradient-computation functions
  and the `LearningRule` interface.

- **`tasks/__init__.py`** — Exports `generate_batch`, `task_accuracy` from both
  tasks.

- **`requirements.txt`** — Added `tqdm` (optional, for progress bars in
  `run_multi_seed`).

### Notebook (`deep_eprop_colab.ipynb`)

**Sections removed from default run** (too slow for one Colab CPU session):
- Section 7: sMNIST / psMNIST at T=784 (cells moved to commented-out appendix)
- Section 8: Spiking LIF networks (OUT of main notebook per spec; code intact)
- Section 6/Exp 6: ALIF networks (same)
- Section 9: Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) — removed entirely
- Section 10: Heterogeneous LIF (OUT of main notebook)

**Changes to kept sections:**
- Depth sweep: `DEPTHS_SWEEP` capped at `[1, 2, 3]` (was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`)
- Master config block added near top (all tunable knobs in one cell, clearly
  marked for easy scale-up)
- Every section now saves figures/metrics to disk immediately on completion so a
  timeout never loses finished results
- Imports updated: `LeakyRNN` imported from `models.leaky_rnn`

**New section added:**
- Exp 5: Cue Accumulation + Leaky RNN — gradient cosine vs delay D and learning
  curves; primary demonstration of the e-prop > d=0 wedge on the new task

**Appendix (commented-out):**
- sMNIST / psMNIST cells appended after all figures are saved, left commented
  out and clearly labelled as opt-in

### Deferred (TODO stubs only)

- Classify-then-count compositional variant of cue_accumulation
  (`# TODO: compositional cue task — each cue is a pattern to classify first`)
- Spiking ALIF version of cue_accumulation
  (`# TODO: ALIF version of cue_accumulation task`)
